<p style="font-weight:bold">Please take 5 minutes to read the installation instructions carefully and completely! This will ensure a proper and easy installation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>

<li>Open file <b>settings.php</b> in a powerful plain text editor, such as the free <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.<br />&nbsp;</li>

<li>Customize the settings to fit your needs. All settings are in this format:
<pre>$settings['DO NOT CHANGE THIS'] = '<span style="color:green">CHANGE THIS</span>';</pre>
For example, to change the administration password to <span class="dest">myPassword</span>, modify line:
<pre>$settings['apass'] = '<span class="dest">admin</span>';</pre>
To this:
<pre>$settings['apass'] = '<span class="dest">myPassword</span>';</pre>

Don't be discouraged by the number of available options, you only need to modify a handful to get started:<br />&nbsp;<br />

<b>Setting to 1</b> will display the security number in a generated <b>image</b>. For this to work
your server must have GD library installed. You can test if your server supports all the required
functions by uploading the <b>gd_test.php</b> file to your server and open it in your browser.
If you get a red image with text WORKS your server shouldn't have problems with it. If you get an error
when opening gd_test.php try using the text version as explained below or ask your hosting company to install the GD library for PHP.<br /><br />
<b>Setting to 2</b> will display the security number in <b>text format</b>. While this is
not as effective as an image it will still block the majority of known spam robots.<br /><br />

to some random sequence of chars and numbers, for example <b>dhjx72js</b>. It doesn't really matter how long it is,
but you should use only chars (a-zA-Z) and digits (0-9). Don't leave the default value
(as it would loose the whole point), set it to something of your own. Examples would be
g3oyf98, p9ak85i, h398dgf and similar. Again, DO NOT USE these examples, just type some chars of your own!<br /><br />

<h2 id="header">&raquo; Customize header and footer</h2>

<p>To quickly and easily modify the header and footer of your guestbook you can edit header.txt and footer.txt files. Simply paste the HTML code you want to appear
before GBook (just after &lt;body&gt; tag) in the header.txt and code that should appear after GBook (just before &lt;/body&gt;) in the footer.txt file. Use only valid (X)HTML code without
any &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; tags.</p>
<p>You will have to use <b>full image URLs</b> in the code. For example instead of &lt;img src="images/image.jpg" ... &gt; use &lt;img src="http://www.example.com/images/image.jpg" ... &gt;!
Same goes for any Javascripts or CSS files if you are calling them from within the header or footer.</p>

<h2 id="customize">&raquo; Templates (customize the look and feel)</h2>

<p>As of version 1.7 GBook support templates that will allow full control over GBook look and feel, easy switching between templates and sharing custom templates with other users.</p>

<p><span class="dest">Important:</span> before modifying templates make sure your GBook works 100% correctly with the default template!</p>

<p>Templates are located inside the <b>templates</b> folder. Each template is located within a separate folder, for example template <i>default</i>
is located inside <i>templates/<b>default</b></i> folder.</p>

<p>Template files have *.php extensions, you can open the files in any plain text editor. They contain valid XHTML code along with
some PHP code (for printing variables). Feel free to modify the HTML code, but do not modify any PHP code (starts with <b>&lt;?php</b> and ends with <b>?&gt;</b>)
unless you are familiar with PHP as this code is used to insert text and data into the templates.</p>

<p><span class="dest">Note:</span> on many servers template names are CaSe SeNSiTiVe!</p>

<h3>--&raquo; Template folder format and contents</h3>

<p>These are the files and folders included in the 'default' template:</p>

<pre>
/default  (folder with template)
    |- /images  (folder with images used)
    |      |- /emoticons  (folder with smileys used)

<h3>--&raquo; Create a new template</h3>

<p>A few tips for creating a new template.</p>

<ol>
<li>Before modifying template make sure your GBook works 100% correctly with the default template!</li>

<li>Choose a name for your new template, for example <b>Dark Knight</b>. Create a new directory inside the templates
folder that will contain all the files for the new template. Name it to something like <b>dark_knight</b>. I
recommend using only lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9) and underscores (_).</li>

<li>Copy all the files from the default template to your new folder.</li>

<li>Set the $settings['template'] to the name of your new template, for example:<br />
$settings['template'] = 'dark_knight';</li>

<li>Make small changes to the template files and test them to make sure GBook is still working as expected.</li>

<li>It is best to start with files style.css, overall_header.php, overall_footer.php and comments.php</li>

<li>If GBook became empty after modifying the template it is probably an error in the code. You should get more information about PHP errors (such as the exact file and line where the error occurred)
by deleting this code from the settings.php file:
<pre>ini_set('display_errors', 0);
ini_set('log_errors', 1);</pre>
Once GBook is working normally you should paste the code back into the settings.php file!</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="translate">&raquo; Translating GBook to your language</h2>

<p>To translate GBook to your language follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate file <b>language.inc.php</b> and open it in a plain text editor like Notepad or Wordpad.</li>
<li>Save the file as <b>yourlanguage.inc.php</b> (deutsch.inc.php, francais.inc.php, ...).</li>
<li>Edit the language file header (first lines that start with *) with your information. Please follow the provided format.</li>
<li>Translate all lines containing language. You may translate <b>only the right side of each line</b>, for example:<br /><br />
$t['DO_NOT_CHANGE_THIS']='TRANSLATE WORDS HERE';<br /><br />
<p><span class="dest">When translating make sure to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>keep the line format: single quotes (') around each phrase and lines must end with a semi-colon (;)</li>
<li>if you use single quotes in the words escape them with a backslash (\). WRONG: can't CORRECT: can\'t</li>
<li>do not change these codes as they are used by GBook: %s %d</li>
</ul>
<br />
</li>
<li>Save the file and upload it to your server.</li>
<li>Edit the <b>$settings['language']</b> setting in your settings.php and upload the modified file to your server.</li>
<li>Test GBook with your language and make sure it works ok.</li>
<li>If possible you should also translate this readme.htm file (please name it <b>readme-yourlanguage.htm</b>, for example readme-fr.htm, readme-de.htm, ...).</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="dest">If you translate GBook to your language please post it to the PHPJunkyard forum for others to download.</span></p>

<h2 id="badwords">&raquo; Adding / Translating bad words list</h2>

<p>To add new bad words open the en.php file (located in <i>badwords</i> folder) in your favorite <b>PLAIN TEXT</b> editor (like Notepad or Wordpad on Windows systems, DO NOT use MS Word or similar editor), find the comment saying INSERT NEW BAD WORDS BELOW THIS LINE and add new bad words in this format:<br />
  <br />
&quot;BADWORD&quot; =&gt; &quot;REPLACEMENT&quot;,<br />
  <br />
  For example if "asfhkjhfasf" is a bad word you would add this line to the file:<br />
  <br />
&quot;SomeNastyWord&quot; =&gt; &quot;* * *&quot;,<br />
  <br />
  Don't forget to add a comma ( , ) after the line!</p>
<p>If you are translating the bad words file I suggest you leave the English words and add new ones in your language as explained above. Then save the file as two letter country code php file. For example, if you are translating the file in French, you should save the file as <b>fr.php</b> (CaSe SeNSiTiVe!). Upload fr.php to your &quot;badwords&quot; folder, go to settings.php again and set <b>$settings['filter_lang']</b> to <b>&quot;fr&quot;</b> (file name without .php).</p>
<p>Now test the GBook again. If you get an Error or Warning when you try to post a new message this means something is wrong with your language file. It either can't be found (check the name of the file, on most servers names are CaSe SeNsiTiVe!) or something is wrong with PHP syntax in it (make sure all the words are added in<br />
  <b>&quot;BADWORD&quot; =&gt; &quot;REPLACEMENT&quot;,</b> syntax).</p>
<p><b>Please send me the translated file</b>. If you translate the bad words file to your language please send it to info AT phpjunkyard DOT com (or contact me through PHPJunkard.com contact form) and I will make it available to others for download. You may include your name, Web site URL and email address and I will give you proper credit (translated by John Doe. Visit www.yourwebsite.com).</p>
